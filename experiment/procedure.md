## Procedure

Open the "Tank Liquid Inlet" slowly to get the Tank filled up with the desired liquid .The height of the liquid in the Tank should be below the red mark position mentioned on the left wall of the Tank. Now slowly open the "tank liquid outlet", so that the liquid filled height in the tank get constant otherwise the experiment will not start(Tank Liquid Inlet rate=Tank Liquid Outlet rate ).

The data given as input should be ensured to be of following ranges for getting stable steady state.

A literature search was undertaken to find reactor conditions and parameters used in industry for free radical initiated bulk and solution styrene polymerizations. The literature values were used to establish ranges for the control system experiment parameters. Following lists reactor parameters found in literature and the corresponding range considered for each parameters.
